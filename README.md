# nlw-3-Rocketseat
programming marathon NLW (Next Level Week) by Rocketseat. 

The project proposal was to develop a website that allows people to find orphanages close to their location, so that they can make visits.
A social project that seeks to encourage people to make more visits to children in need.
Css, html, javaScript, nodeJs and API (google maps and whatsApp) were used.
